# mlflow-server-docker
Minimal fully-containerized mlflow server with remote postgres tracking db and sftp artifact store.

# High throughput, reproducible, organized experiments
 
  - Needing a figure from a study you ran 3 years ago, but not being able to find it.
  - Code that used to run now gives different results or errors out
  - You want to use code from a published paper, but it doesn't work when you try to run it.
  - Trying to run code on a different machine does not work, even when using conda or virtual environments.



Computational researchers, especially in non-cs disciplines like engineering, write lots of code to conduct experiments and analyze the results. Unfortunately, they are often expected to start writing code without being taught many of the basic "good practices" of development,

## How it works


## Why docker?


## Why mlflow?



## Isn't this approach overkill?


# Installation

The only dependency of
